# Employee-Detail-Analysis
Data Engineering Project - Capstone project 1 
---------------------------------------------
Prerequisite: upload the data and all other files required to the "https://npbdh.cloudloka.com/ftp/" page.

1. Log in to mysql using : mysql -u anabig114237 -pBigdata123

2. Change the database: 

mysql> Use anabig114237;

3. Create 'cap1.sql' file. It should contain all the queries needed for creation and loading of data.
In sql, run the command: 

mysql> source cap1.sql

4. Use sqoop to import data from sql to hdfs. Suppose we want to import file to a directory, make sure to remove files with the same name as source from the target directory.
if /anabig114237/hive/warehouse is the target dir and table1 is the source table, run the command: 

[anabig114237@ip-10-1-1-204 ~ ]$ hdfs dfs -rm -r /anabig114237/hive/warehouse/table1

5. for importing, run command: 

[anabig114237@ip-10-1-1-204 ~ ]$ sh cap1g.sh

6. transfer schema from local system to hdfs
hdfs dfs -put /home/anabig114237/table1.avsc /user/anabig114237/new/table1.avsc

7. Run the following command.

hive -f command_impala.sql > output.txt

The Output of the Above Command will be Saved in the output.txt
